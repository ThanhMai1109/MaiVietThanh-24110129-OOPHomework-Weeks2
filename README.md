## üìå Introduction
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++ through the implementation of a `Vehicle` class.  

The class models real-world vehicles with attributes (e.g., type, max speed, fuel type, year of manufacture, license plate, etc.) and behaviors (methods like `accelerate()` and `displayInfo()`).  

This program helps:
- Represent the typical attributes of vehicles.  
- Manage and display vehicle details in an organized way.  

It also shows how to:
- Encapsulate data in a class with private attributes and public methods.  
- Initialize objects using constructors.  
- Use file input/output (`input.txt`, `output.txt`) for testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build & Run Instructions

### Compile
```bash
g++ Vehicle.cpp -o Vehicle
```

---

## üì• Input Format
- There are three built-in examples in `main()`.  
- After that, the user can input additional vehicles.  

**Format:**
1. First line: number of vehicles `n`  
2. For each vehicle, input the following (each on a new line):  
   - type  
   - brandName  
   - registrationNumber  
   - modelYear  
   - weight  
   - color  
   - maxSpeed  
   - fuelType

## üí° Reflection
When analyzing the requirements, I identified the main entity: a 'Vehicle' class representing real-world vehicles. The class encapsulates attributes such as type, maximum speed, fuel type, color, usage, mileage, year of manufacture, and license plate.

To implement behaviors, I added methods like `accelerate()` and `displayInfo()` to provide clients with useful information to support decision-making. 

**Challenges faced:**

- Handling input/output properly, especially mixing cin and getline.

- Managing multiple vehicles efficiently with vector<Vehicle>.

- Keeping code clean with CamelCase naming.

**How OOP helped:**

- Encapsulation: Hid the internal representation while exposing meaningful methods.

- Abstraction: Focused on what a vehicle does instead of how details are stored.

- Constructors: Simplified object creation by initializing attributes at once.

This project shows how OOP makes code **organized, reusable, and extendable.**
